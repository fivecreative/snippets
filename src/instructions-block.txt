# Adding a new snippet

## 1.a Clone repo and install dependencies
If you already cloned this repo, go to step 1.b
1. Clone this repo to your local
```bash
git clone git@github.com:fivecreative/snippets.git
```
2. `cd` to the cloned repository folder
```bash
cd snippets
```
3. Run `yarn` or `npm i` depending on your package manager, to download and install dependencies

## 1.b Ensure repository is up to date
1. `cd` to the repo directory
2. enter `git pull origin` to bring your local repository up to date


## 2. Create snippet file
Create your snippet and place in the appropriate subfolder. You can create additional subfolders as you see fit. Snippet files must be in a secondary subfolder. Primary subfolders are used for sorting and indexing.

Your snippet file must include the following at the beginning of the file. for PHP and JS files, include them between comment tags. Do not use newlines on the snippet header

### For PHP
```php
<?php

    /**
     * title: Snippet title here
     * description: A brief description of what my snippet does
     */

    // Your code goes here

?>
```

### For Javascript, CSS and prompts
```javascript
/**
 * title: Snippet title here
 * description: A brief description of what my snippet does
 */

// Your code goes here
```

## 3. Run the directory index generating script
1. `cd` to your repository directory
2. Run `yarn build` or `npm run build` depending on your package manager. This script regenerates the snippet index and automatically increases the version of the repository.
3. Push the updates snipper repo to github. You may need to add your required SSH key to your agent to ensure you have the required permissions. See https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent
```bash
git add . --all
git commit -m "Your commit comment here"
git push origin
```
